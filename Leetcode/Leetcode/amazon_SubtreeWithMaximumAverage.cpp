Subtree: Maximum average node

Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.
Example Given a binary tree:
               1
              /  \
			-5   11
			/ \  / \
		   1  2  4 -2
return the node 11.

Your problem can be different in ways like -- it may not be a binary tree or the average doesn't include the root of the substree.

// TreeNode definition
struct TreeNode {
	int val;
	TreeNode *left;
	TreeNode *right;
	TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
